/**
 * An interface for an adaptable object.
 * <p>
 * Adaptable objects can be dynamically extended to provide different 
 * interfaces (or "adapters").  Adapters are created by adapter 
 * factories, which are in turn managed by type by adapter managers.
 * </p>
 * For example,
 * <pre>
 *     IAdaptable a = [some adaptable];
 *     IFoo x = (IFoo)a.getAdapter(IFoo.class);
 *     if (x != null)
 *         [do IFoo things with x]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface, or obtain a default implementation
 * of this interface by subclassing <code>PlatformObject</code>.
 * </p>
 * @see IAdapterFactory
 * @see IAdapterManager
 * @see PlatformObject
